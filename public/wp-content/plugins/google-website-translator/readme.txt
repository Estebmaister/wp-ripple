= Advantages over similar plugins: =
There are a number of Google translation plugins in this great repository. However, most of them haven't been carefully built. Here's a list of reasons of why you should choose this plugin:

* All the settings are stored in only one record in the database; whilst other plugins use lots of records.
* It's the fastest as it doesn't load any external file; whilst other plugins load unnecessary javascript and css files.
* It includes all the options of the original [Google Website Translator](https://translate.google.com/manager/website/); whilst other plugins offer just a restricted version.
* Prisna Ltd. is a real company ([register record](https://www.prisna.net/images/prisna-limited.pdf)), with professional people working on it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the supported languages? =

= How can I exclude some parts from being translated? =
You should go to:

Advanced &gt; General &gt; Exclude selector (jQuery)

Enter a *jQuery* selector to specify the area(s) you'd like to exclude from translation.

Alternatively, you can add the *notranslate* style class to the container HTML element. Or if you want to exclude just a piece of text, you should wrap it within a HTML element with the *notranslate* style class, for instance:

&lt;span class=&quot;notranslate&quot;&gt;Company name&lt;/span&gt;

= I have a lot of plugins, will this plugin slow down my website? =
This plugin has a lot of options for you to customize it in the best possible way. All these options are saved in only one database record (yes, only one!). So you can rest assured it won't slow down your website. Sometimes your website slows down when you use more and more plugins, because most likely they haven't been built carefully. If you have some understanding of code, you can search for the *add_option* function within your plugins files to check on this matter.

= Google translate is not free, do I need to pay any money to use this plugin? =
No, you don't need to pay anything. Even though Google translate isn't free anymore, Google has created a free translation widget for everybody to use. This plugin brings you that widget for you to easily use it in your WordPress powered website.

= What kind of support do you provide? =
Support includes:

* Responding to questions or problems regarding the plugin and its features.
* Fixing bugs and reported issues.
* Providing updates to ensure compatibility with new WordPress versions.
