==========

First off: thanks for looking into contributing to Babble, we appreciate your help.

Setting up
----------

1. Clone this git repository on your WordPress development site.
2. Switch to the develop branch

Submitting patches
------------------

Whether you want to fix a bug or implement a new feature, the process is much the same:

0. [Search existing issues](https://github.com/cftp/babble/issues); if you can't find anything related to what you want to work on, open a new issue so that you can get some initial feedback.
1. [Fork](https://github.com/cftp/babble/fork) the repository.
2. Push the code changes from your local clone to your fork.
3. Open a pull request to the *develop* branch.

It doesn't matter if the code isn't perfect. The idea is to get it reviewed early and iterate on it.
